## Getting started with Terraform and Azure

## Getting Terraform

How to install Terraform https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install
How to install Azure CLI https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli#install-or-update
How to install Code https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows

## Basic commands

```bash
# Check the terraform version
terraform -v
terraform -h
```

## Setup a new project

```bash
mkdir terraform-101/
```

## Identify the provider to use

1. Open the terraform provider catalog https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers
2. Select the provider that allows you to manage the type of resources you want. Eg. Azure or AWS, GitHub, DNS records, Kubernetes resources, etc.
3. Read the documentation to initialize the provider. Most likely, it will require a configuration to authenticate.

## Configure the Azure provider

We want to get started with Terraform and the Azure provider. Therefore, we open the documentation of the provider https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs

### Authenticate with Azure

The provider requires authentication to be able to perform requests to the Azure API, it offers multiple methos to do it:

- Azure CLI
- Managed Service Identity
- Service Principal and a Client Certificate
- Service Principal and a Client Secret
- OpenID Connect

For now, we will make use of the Azure CLI to authenticate, since it is the simplest method.

```bash
az login
```

### Create the first configuration file

Create a file called `main.tf` and add the following contents

```tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "=3.0.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Microsoft Azure Provider
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
```

### Initialize the terraform project

The init command should be executed when:
- **The initial setup is just created**
- New providers have been added or existing ones have been modified
- Backend configuration is modified

Since this is the initial setup, we need to run the init command.

```bash
terraform init
```

### Create the first resource

Append the following configuration to the `main.tf` file.

```tf
# Create a resource group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "main_resource_group" {
  name     = "rg-andres"
  location = "West Europe"
}
```

Now you can run the command `terraform plan` to print the execution plan.

If you are happy with the execution plan, then you can run `terraform apply` to create the resource.

### Add more resources to the configuration

Append the following configuration to the `main.tf` file.

```tf
# Create a virtual network within the resource group
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "prd_network" {
  name                = "prd-network"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main_resource_group.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main_resource_group.location
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]

  tags = {
    environment = "Production"
  }
}
```

Run the command `terraform plan` to check the execution plan.
Run `terraform apply` to create the Virtual Network.

Let's say that we need to update the tags of the current network configuration, we need to add a new tag `team = "NHLS"`.
Please add it to the `tags` block. The virtual network resource should look like this now

```tf
# Create a virtual network within the resource group
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "prd_network" {
  name                = "prd-network"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main_resource_group.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main_resource_group.location
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]

  tags = {
    environment = "Production"
    team = "NHLS"
  }
}
```

Once modified, you can re-run the `terraform plan` command to see how the result of the execution plan.

Let's now modify the name of the network, instead of `"prd-network"` let's call it `"production-network"`.

Once more, execute the command `terraform plan` to see the execution plan. This time you will notice that terraform will recreate the resource. It means the resource will be removed and created again.

### Remove one resource from the infrastructure

We can remove resources by removing the resource block. Remove the resource block that defines the configuration of the Virtual Network.

```tf
# All this block should be removed!!
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "prd_network" {
  name                = "prd-network"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main_resource_group.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main_resource_group.location
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]

  tags = {
    environment = "Production"
    team = "NHLS"
  }
}
```

Once the block is removed, execute the plan command to get the execution plan `terraform plan`.

As you can see, the execution plan indicates that one resource will be removed, the Virtual Network.

If we execute the apply command, terraform will remove the Virtual Network `terraform apply`.
