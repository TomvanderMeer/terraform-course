### Make use of an additional provider

Signup to your Github account and get a personal [access token token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) and select the `repo` and `delete_repo` scopes.

In the terraform block add the github module configuration

```tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    ...
    github = {
      source  = "integrations/github"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}
```

Add also the provider configuration block

```tf
provider "github" {
  token = "YOUR_TOKEN"
  owner = "YOUR_USERNAME"
}
```

Now you can append the resource block to create a new repository

```tf
resource "github_repository" "repo" {
  name        = "terraform-configs"
  description = "My terraform configurations!"

  visibility = "private"
}
```

Since we added a new provider we need to run the init command to get the provder locally to be able to use it.

```bash
terraform init
```

Terraform installs the module and it is ready to run the plan and apply commands to get the execution plan and apply the infrastructure.

```bash
terraform plan
```

If you are happy with the execution plan then you can run the apply command

```bash
terraform apply
```
