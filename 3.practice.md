    - A new SQL Server and database, use the cheapest possible.
        - Configure the server with a admin username and password.
        - The password of this admin user should be generated by terraform and stored in the Key Vault.
- The output variables should consider the connection string **without the password**
- Once the resources are created with Terraform, let the instructor validate it.
- After the instructor validated the operation you can make use of the delete command to remove the resources
